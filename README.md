# TH08-Gulp-Packaging
Full Stack Java Script Project 08 - Treehouse TechDegree

Using Gulp to Build a Front End Website

In this project you’ll be provided a website with HTML, SCSS, JPEGs, PNGs and JavaScript files. You’ll be required to set up a Gulp build process to prepare the website for deployment.

The build process must fulfill the following criteria:

Concatenate and minify the JavaScript files
Compile SCSS into CSS in a concatenated and minified file
Generate JavaScript and CSS source maps
Compress any JPEG or PNG files
All output for the build process should be in a dist folder for distribution or deployment.


## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

As a developer, when I run the default gulp command, it should continuously watch for changes to any .scss file in my project. When there is a change to one of the .scss files, the gulp styles command is run and the files are compiled, concatenated, and minified to the dist folder. My project should then reload in the browser, displaying the changes.
